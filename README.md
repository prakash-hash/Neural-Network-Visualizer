# Neural-Network-Visualizer

A Simple neural network visualizer which is trained on the mnist dataset with simple neural network with tensorflow
It shows 3 layers. The first 2 layers are the hidden Dense layer with 32 nodes each and represent 32 subplots in each layer.
The last layer i.e layer 3 is the output layer and has 10 nodes that shows the propabiblity of the digits from 0-9 and the brighter the node is the greater probability of the number
