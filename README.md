# Neural-Network-Visualizer
https://s4a.streamlit.io/prakash-hash/neural-network-visualizer/master/app.py/+/

A Simple neural network visualizer which is trained on the mnist dataset with simple neural network with tensorflow.</br>
It shows 3 layers. The first 2 layers are the hidden Dense layer with 32 nodes each and represent 32 subplots in each layer.</br>
The last layer i.e layer 3 is the output layer and has 10 nodes that shows the propabiblity of the digits from 0-9 and the brighter the node is the greater probability of the number </br>
All the backend work done in python and the frontend work done on <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">streamlit</a> which is an awesome library for making a GUI for the the ML models.
